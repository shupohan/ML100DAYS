### 請找出一個你認為機器學習可以發光發熱的領域並闡述原因?

I believe machine learning can have a big break through in Pharmacology. In tradition, scientist needs a very long time to develop new drug or vaccine, but scientist can shorten the time of development with the assistance of machine learning. For example, COVID-19 has put the world in a chaos and this pandemic has taken thousands of lives over the world. Making a vaccine often takes years to complete. However, machine learning can help to design models to find protine pattern, T-cells or even make an immunology model to predict whether the vaccine can work on the human or not. Development of COVID-19 vaccine can be expected to be done at least 12 months.
